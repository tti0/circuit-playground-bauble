# circuit-playground-bauble

A festive sketch for the Adafruit Circuit Playground Classic, with coloured lights and optional music. No additional hardware required.

## Description

The CircuitPlayground NeoPixels will display these patterns, in a loop:

+ Red/green/white flash
+ Twinkling cool white
+ Twinkling warm white
+ Rainbow

If the slide-switch is activated, the loop will include music played on the piezo buzzer: a short arrangement of *Hark! The Herald Angels Sing*.

## Instructions

Using the Arduino IDE, open `circuit-playground-bauble.ino`, and flash to the Circuit Playground.
